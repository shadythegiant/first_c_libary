How it Works:
The Loop: while (*s && *s != c)

This loop continues as long as two things are true:

\*s: The current character is not the null terminator (\0).

\*s != c: The current character is not the one we're looking for.

The loop will stop for one of two reasons: it either found the character (*s == c) or it hit the end of the string (*s == '\0').

The Check: if (\*s == c)

This if statement figures out why the loop stopped.

Case 1 (Character Found): If the loop stopped because \*s == c, this if is true, and it correctly returns the pointer s.

Case 2 (Character Not Found): If the loop stopped because \*s == '\0' (and c was not \0), this if is false. The function continues to the next line.

Case 3 (Searching for \0): This is the key edge case. If c itself is \0, the loop will stop when *s becomes \0 (because the *s part of the while condition becomes false). The code then checks if ('\0' == '\0'). This is true, and the function correctly returns the pointer to the null terminator, which is the standard behavior for strchr.

The Return: return (NULL);

This line is only reached in Case 2 (the character wasn't found, and we weren't looking for the null terminator). This is the correct behavior.
